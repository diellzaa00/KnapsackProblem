# KnapsackProblem
In this project, I implemented three different algorithms, namely Simulated Annealing, Greedy Search, and Dynamic Programming, to solve the Knapsack Problem.
The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a combination of items with specific weights and values to maximize the total value while staying within a given weight
constraint. Each algorithm was implemented in Java, offering unique approaches to optimize the solution and find the best item combination.
Through this project, I aimed to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms in solving the Knapsack Problem.
